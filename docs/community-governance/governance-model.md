# Governance Model

DumpFun is committed to being a community-driven platform where users have a direct say in the platform's direction and development. Our governance model is designed to be transparent, fair, and decentralized, giving $DUMP token holders the power to influence key decisions.

## Decentralized Governance
The governance of DumpFun is decentralized, meaning that no single entity has control over the platform's decisions. Instead, governance is carried out by the community of $DUMP token holders, who can propose, discuss, and vote on important issues.

## Proposal System
Any $DUMP token holder can submit a proposal for changes or new initiatives within the DumpFun platform. Proposals can cover a wide range of topics, including changes to the reward system, new feature development, partnerships, or platform upgrades. To ensure that proposals are well-thought-out and beneficial to the community, a minimum threshold of $DUMP tokens is required to submit a proposal.

## Community Review
Once a proposal is submitted, it enters a review period where the community can discuss and provide feedback. This period allows for open debate and consideration of the potential impact of the proposal. The community can engage in discussions through the official forums, Discord, or social media.

## Voting Power
Voting on proposals is weighted based on the number of $DUMP tokens a user holds. The more tokens a user has, the greater their voting power. This system ensures that those with a larger stake in the platform have a proportionate influence on its direction, while still allowing all token holders to have a voice.

## Transparency
All proposals, discussions, and voting results are publicly available on the blockchain. This transparency ensures that the governance process is fair, open, and accountable to the community.
