# User Journey

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet
Users begin by connecting their cryptocurrency wallet to the DumpFun platform, allowing the platform to identify and access the tokens held in the userâ€™s wallet across supported blockchains.

## Step 2: Select Tokens to Dump
Once connected, users can view a list of tokens in their wallet. They select the tokens they wish to burn, with the platform providing information on eligibility for $DUMP rewards.

## Step 3: Verify and Confirm
The platform checks the tokens' LP status and value. If they meet the criteria, users are informed of the potential $DUMP tokens they will earn. If not, they are prompted with a warning.

## Step 4: Execute the Dump
Upon confirmation, the smart contract is executed, and the tokens are permanently burned. The process is secure and irreversible.

## Step 5: Earn $DUMP Tokens and Accolades
Users are awarded $DUMP tokens based on the value of the tokens burned. Social accolades and achievements are earned for contributing to the platform.

## Step 6: Track Progress and Engage with the Community
Users can track their progress, view leaderboards, and participate in community challenges to earn additional rewards.
