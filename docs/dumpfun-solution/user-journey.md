# User Journey

## Step 1: Connect Multi-Chain Wallets

Users begin by connecting their cryptocurrency wallets from supported blockchains (e.g., Solana, Ethereum, Base) to the DumpFun platform. This allows the platform to identify and access the meme coins held in the user's wallets across different blockchains.

##  Step 2: Explore Cross-Chain Meme Coins

Once connected, users can view a consolidated list of their meme coins across all supported blockchains. They can explore market data, trends, and trading opportunities within the platform.

##  Step 3: Trade, Burn, or Provide Liquidity

    **  Trade Meme Coins**: Users can buy, sell, or bid on meme coins across supported blockchains with instant cross-chain liquidity. Advanced trading tools and real-time analytics assist in making informed decisions.

    **Burn Underperforming Tokens**: Users can select meme coins they wish to burn to declutter their portfolio. The platform provides information on the eligibility for $DUMP rewards based on the tokens' criteria.

    **  Provide Liquidity**: Users can contribute to liquidity pools across different blockchains directly from the platform, earning rewards for their contributions.

## Step 4: Verify and Confirm Transactions

For each action (trading, burning, providing liquidity), the platform securely handles the necessary cross-chain transactions using audited smart contracts. Users receive confirmations and can review transaction details before execution.

## Step 5: Earn $DUMP Tokens and Accolades

After completing actions, users are awarded $DUMP tokens based on the value and criteria of their activities. They also earn social accolades, achievements, and climb leaderboards, enhancing their status within the community.

## Step 6: Engage with the Community

Users can participate in community events, governance decisions through the DAO, and interact with other members. They can track their progress, compare with others on leaderboards, and participate in challenges to earn additional rewards.

## Step 7: Manage and Optimize Portfolio

The platform provides advanced tools for users to manage their meme coin portfolios across multiple blockchains. Users can monitor performance, set alerts, and adjust their strategies to optimize their holdings.
