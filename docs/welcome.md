# Introduction

## 1.1 Overview of DumpFun
DumpFun is an innovative web3 platform designed to help cryptocurrency holders eliminate bad tokens from their wallets and portfolios. In the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, many investors find themselves holding tokens that have lost value, become illiquid, or were part of questionable projects. DumpFun provides a fun and rewarding way to cleanse your portfolio by burning these bad tokens to reclaim Sol while also earning $DUMP points that can be used within the ecosystem. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) principles, DumpFun aims to bring a sense of relief and entertainment to crypto enthusiasts who are tired of holding onto worthless tokens while generating awareness and encouraging caution to new Web3 users.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
The explosion of the cryptocurrency market has led to the creation of thousands of tokens, many of which were developed with little to no real value or utility. These tokens often become illiquid, with little trading volume, and are eventually abandoned by their creators. Investors who hold these tokens are left with assets that are nearly impossible to sell, leading to frustration and financial loss. Traditional methods of removing these tokens, such as selling at a loss or holding onto them indefinitely, offer no satisfactory solution.

Moreover, these bad tokens can clutter portfolios, making it difficult for investors to focus on assets that have real potential. The lack of a structured and incentivized system to deal with these bad tokens has left many investors searching for a way to clean up their portfolios.

DumpFun addresses this problem by offering a unique platform where users can dump their bad tokens in exchange for $DUMP points. These points not only serve as a reward but also give users a sense of satisfaction and engagement in the process. By making the act of dumping tokens fun and rewarding, DumpFun transforms a negative experience into a positive one.

## 1.3 Mission Statement
DumpFun’s mission is to help crypto holders refresh their portfolios by transforming underperforming tokens into rewards. We’re here to turn the task of managing your assets into a fun and engaging experience, all while reducing the token supply of good projects and building a community that values smart, strategic participation.
